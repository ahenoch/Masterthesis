Of these, the influenza viruses of duck and budgerigar origin replicated in the intestinal tract of the ducks. The infected ducks shed the virus in the feces to high titers, but did not show clinical signs of disease and scarcely produced detectable serum antibodies. Using immunofluorescent staining, we demonstrated that the target cells of the duck virus in ducks were the simple columnar epithelial cells which form crypts in the large intestines, especially in the colon. After primary infection, the birds resisted reinfection with the duck virus at least for 28 days, but from 46 days onward they were susceptible to reinfection. These infections were quickly restricted by a brisk secondary immune response, reflected in the rapid appearance of high titers of antibody after reinoculation. In contrat to the avian influenza viruses, the remaining three influenza viruses of human origin did not replicate in the intestinal tract but did cause a serum antibody response.},
