For a basic overview of the sequences in the FASTA file, the numbers of sequences of segment 4 and 6, related to the subtypes of \gls{HA} and \gls{NA} were counted and visualized (\autoref{fig:Frequency}). Hereby, the high number of segment 4 sequences of subtype H1 and H3 in \autoref{subfig:Frequency_4} and segment 6 sequences of N1 and N2 in \autoref{subfig:Frequency_6} was noticeable. Furthermore, the similarity of the number of sequences of segment 4 subtype H1 and N1, as well as of segment 6 H3 and N2 was also remarkable. The similarity seem to originate from the frequency of subtype combinations H1N1 and H3N2 of the full genomes, which is also in line with the most prominent subtypes of \gls{IAV} mentioned in \textcite{deng_simplified_2015}. In addition to that, a high number of not classified sequences named \glqq none\grqq{} is present in the data. These unclassified sequences were possibly sequenced without prior subtype testing or are in fact sequences that do not belong to either of the known subtypes \autocite{noauthor_revision_1980}.

Sequences related to subtypes H1 and H3 were the most frequent ones from segment 4 with a total number of 17627 and 23074. Subtype H5 was also slightly over-represented with 3195 sequences. 1191 sequences from segment 4 in the data had no classification and are listed as \glqq none\grqq{}.

As described in \autoref{chap:Materials_and_Methods}, the clustering was performed multiple times to compare different methods for their quality and efficiency of \gls{IAV} clustering. The four methods were compared directly to each other in the following. For better separation, the four methods were called by their abbreviation, to be found in \autoref{tab:methods}. As a short reminder, PD used direct reduction to 30 components with \texttt{PCA}, following $\varepsilon$ exploration with the \gls{DBCV} and PK used the same reduction but exploration with the Kneedle Algorithm instead. Method UD and UK were performed in a similar way but with reduction to 100 components by \texttt{PCA} and to 30 afterwards by \texttt{UMAP}. The numbered workflows in \autoref{fig:Vectorization_Pipeline}, \autoref{fig:Clustering_Pipeline} and \autoref{fig:Tree_Pipeline} represent the different methods.

To choose a reasonable number of components for the \texttt{PCA}, mentioned in \autoref{sec:PCA}, the 7-mer frequency vectors of segment 4 were reduced by running \texttt{PCA} with different settings (\autoref{fig:Vectorization_Pipeline} and \autoref{tab:PCA_Dimension}). The sum of explained variance for every setting were calculated and listed in \autoref{tab:PCA_Dimension}. Because of the high increase of explained variance from 10 to 20 components with 58.7\% to 68.7\% and likewise to 30 components with 73.9\% explained variance, a value of 30 was used as default in this project. A fairly small value was used, due to increasing computational effort of the \texttt{PCA} implementation and also to preserve the usability of spanning tree calculation with \texttt{HDBSCAN}. Calculation of the spanning tree by \texttt{HDBSCAN} is, with the preferred settings, only possible up to $\approx$ 50 components. For better comparison of the methods, the final number of components of the \texttt{UMAP} reduction in UD and UK was also set to 30. Therefore, clustering with all the methods was performed on vectors with 30 components.

A result of 0.587, as for extracted 10 components, represents 58.7\% of the variance explained by the first 10 components of the vector. The more components were extracted the lower the increase in additional explained variance \autocite{pearson_liii_1901}.}

In both cases the difference is exactly matching the relation of squared euclidean distance divided by two equals the cosine distance, as described in \autoref{sec:HDBSCAN}, further proving the relation of the distances. Crowding of the points in the right graph, representing reduction with \texttt{UMAP}, most likely can be explained by the embedding mechanism of the tool, that further reduces the distance of similar vectors \autocite{mcinnes_umap_2020}.}

For the graphical comparison of the demonstrated mathematical proof of the close relation of the euclidean distance of the L2-norm normalized vectors and the cosine distance (\autoref{sec:HDBSCAN}), subsets of the real data were used. In \autoref{subfig:Normalisation_PCA}, a subset of 100 7-mer frequency vectors of segment 4 were reduced by \texttt{PCA}, L2-norm normalized and compared to each other by euclidean and cosine distance, as described in \autoref{sec:PCA} and \autoref{sec:HDBSCAN}. All the calculated distances for euclidean distance were then plotted against the cosine distances. The red line indicates the relation as calculated in \autoref{sec:HDBSCAN}. All the points are arranged exactly along the red line which confirmed the calculation and relation of the used euclidean distance on L2-norm normalized vectors to the cosine distance, that was intended to be used in the first place. The same procedure was repeated with the use of the \texttt{UMAP} workflow, resulting in the same graphical proof (\autoref{subfig:Normalisation_UMAP}). In \autoref{subfig:Normalisation_UMAP}, all the points are crowded much more to a dense area of the curve. This is most likely reasoned by the number of neighbors setting and the embedding behavior of \texttt{UMAP} and will be discussed in \autoref{sec:Dimension_Reduction}.
