\chapter*{Abstract}

Reoccurring local outbreaks of new, highly pathogenic strains of the \gls{IAV}, picture a unnoticed but still persisting major danger to the whole human population, that reached global extend with high numbers of fatalities, several times in the past. Due to the lack of a cure, resort to vaccines producing varying levels of immunization with yearly expiration is inevitable. For better preparation on possible future pandemics, enlarging the knowledge of the \gls{IAV} is crucial. High evolution-rates by more drastic mutation mechanisms of the \gls{IAV} and a classification giving little insight, complicate accurate novel research though. This thesis, serves the elaboration of a segment-wise clustering pipeline, usable on all sequenced genomes of \gls{IAV}. Instead of being alignment based, this method utilizes the better scalablity of $k$-mer frequency vectors, with the novel hybrid clustering implementation of \texttt{HDBSCAN}, connecting hierarchical with density-based clustering. Appropriate parameters were selected by different validation techniques and well-known tools were used for dimension reduction of the vectors. By in depth comparison of the results, a workflow combining a novel vector clustering method with validated parameters, posterior to an efficient dimension reduction, was proposed.
